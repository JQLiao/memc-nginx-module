This is an enhanced ngx_memcached module that supports
get/set/add/delete and more memcached commands.

Status
    The following memcached commands have been implemented
    and tested:
        get
        set
        add
        replace
        append
        prepend
        flush_all (the delay argument is unsupported)
        version

Note that at least memcached version 1.2.2 does not support
the "append" and "prepend" commands. At least 1.2.4 and later
versions seem to supports these two commands.

Examples

    # GET /foo?key=dog
    # POST /foo?key=cat
    # PUT /foo?key=bird
    # DELETE /foo?key=Tiger
    location /foo {
        set $memc_key $arg_key;

        # $memc_cmd defaults to get for GET,
        #   add for POST, set for PUT, and
        #   delete for the DELETE request method.

        memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11984;
    }

    # GET /bar?cmd=get&key=cat
    # POST /bar?cmd=set&key=dog
    # DELETE /bar?cmd=delete&key=dog
    # GET /bar?cmd=delete&key=dog
    location /bar {
        set $memc_cmd $arg_cmd;
        set $memc_key $arg_key;

        memc_pass 127.0.0.1:11984;
    }

Installation
    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.28 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.28.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.28.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.28/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/memc-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    memc-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/memc-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.28)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.63 (last tested version is 0.7.64)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.63 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.
